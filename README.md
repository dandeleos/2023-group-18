## 2. Introduction (5% ~250 words)

Our game, TankWar!, is based on the game Tank Trouble, a game consisting of two tanks which set out to destroy the other tank. The player controls their tank using the up, down, left and right commands to guide their tank around a map. The user uses their mouse to fire through clicking. The enemy tank is an AI which seeks out the player's tank in order to destory it. The key difference between our game, TankWar!, and the game Tank Trouble is the implementation of levels. Tank Trouble has an AI which retains the same difficulty within each player attempt whereas with TankWar!, the AI becomes increasingly more advanced through greater health and speed which ensures that the game becomes harder with every level the player user advances.  

## 3. Requirements (15% ~750 words)

o Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

Our team decided to take an inclusive approach to developing our game by ensuring that all team members contributed ideas and were engaged in decisionmaking. First, each team member raised potential game ideas for other team members to consider: some ideas that came out of this process include a variation of Boxhead (a zombie shooting game) and Cube Runner (avoid cubes in a field). We considered games of all types at this stage: we did not want to be narrowed into choosing a particular genre of game. To facilitate this process, we had a group meeting where we discussed potential game ideas. 

To help us understand whether it was feasible to build these game ideas, we ended up building use-case diagrams for some of them. These were done on paper as a 'paper prototyping' process. 

We eventually settled on a variation of Tank Trouble. This decision was on multiple factors, including our ability to code this game within the deadline, a careful consideration of potential player engagement and on team member interest. After careful consideration, we decided to choose TankWar! as our game. Out of all our game ideas, we believed that this would be the most interesting, as the AI for the enemy tank would add a level of challenge to the players. From the perspective of the members too, the project was compelling, as coding an AI would mean implementing some search algorithms that we had not implemented before. 

Once we decided on a variation of TankWar!, we created several paper prototypes. An initial prototype included several enemy tanks and the inclusion of non-playable characters that would affect the score of the player, but this was abandoned as we believed that these features would detract from gameplay. 

DISCUSS FINAL USECASE DIAGRAM

We used a Kanban board throughout this process in order to facilitate the management of the workload. 

## 4. Design (15% ~750 words)

o System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams.

The design of the game was done  in a manner more resembling Waterfall than Agile. Although Waterfall is not generally the software development process employed in the creation of games, after careful analysis of this module, we felt that this was more suitable. 

## 5. Implementation (15% ~750 words)

o Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game.

## 6. Evaluation (15% ~750 words)

o One qualitative evaluation (your choice)

o One quantitative evaluation (of your choice)

o Description of how code was tested.

## 7. Process (15% ~750 words)

o Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together.

## 8. Conclusion (10% ~500 words)

o Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work.
