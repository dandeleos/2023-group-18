## 2. Introduction (5% ~250 words)

o Our game is based on the game Tank trouble, a game consisting of two tanks which set out to destroy the other tank. The player controls their tank using the up, down, left and right commands to guide their tank around a map. The user uses their mouse to fire through clicking. The enemy tank is an AI which seeks out the player's tank in order to destory it. The key difference between our game, Tankwar! and the game Tank Trouble is the implementation of levels. Tank Trouble only consists of an AI which retains the same difficulty within each player attempt whereas with TankWar!, the AI becomes increasingly more advanced through greater health and speed which ensures that the game becomes harder with every level the player user advances.  

## 3. Requirements (15% ~750 words)

o Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?


Our team first and foremost decided to take an inclusive approach to first 

Note: rough pla of our requirements for our game: 

We first drew a USE-case diagram through aritulating user stories. 
Considered a variety of games- boxhead like game, variation of cube runner, 
let members come up with their own ideas 

We made use case diagrams for every paper prototype discussing user stories- writing each use case diagram on paper


eventually settled on a variation of Tank trouble- through a group consensus. We felt this would be an engaging game both for the user
and for the developers as some were programming an AI for the first time. 
Once we decided on the game variation, we did several different paper prototype variations
For the first paper prototype of Tank War, within our paper protype design we included certain attributes of the game that upon reflection 
we felt were unnecessary and would make the game less engaging with a faulty scoring mechanism. 
Our final paper prototype was an improvement on the first draft, however this improvement we again felt on reflection was not practical giving the time constraints that we as a team had for implementing this game. This paper prototype involved mutiple AI tanks and considering the additional work which each team member had, the feasibility of this paper prototype seemed impractical. 

Finally, after after again discussing user stories we created a use-case diagram which reflected the early designs of a feasible game which could 
be programmed by the developers given the timing constraints and possibilities that the processing programming langugage afforded. 
Disucss other feasibility considerations that occurred. 
Now disucss the actual use case diagram of the game. 
Earlier maybe discuss the impracticilities of the earlier game a bit more. 

The actual process of going through it, the Kanban board which was updated the entire time helped with our process our creating and establishing requirements.
