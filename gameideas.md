# Ideas for games

Boxhead-like game - fighting/killing zombies

From Dan: I found several Boxhead-like games, is it a tower defence game and player can control a soldier to shoot zombies?

I figure that a tank war or aircraft war is easier to beginners, but we can do some additional aswsome stuff inside the program which depends on our imagination.
BTWï¼Œ I really dislike Tetris because it is boring, no passion sleepy game. I hope to make some thing let player feel excited!

From Charlie: So I was thinking of a variation of cube runner: a game 
where you dodge shapes at a certain speed and the further you get ,the 
quicker you go. also, the colour of the game changes as you get faster. 
Speeds would increase at certain points in the game as you progress

Also second idea: slime games anyone? can't find it online right now but 
that's a great game
